# Introducing HTML5 – HTML Standards

## WHATWG

Visit the site http://www.whatwg.org/.

Section 4.4 defines various 'sectioning' elements (such as `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<header>`). Find this section in both versions of the specification. Look up the `<section>` element in each.

## W3C

The standards are also available at http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/. (There is an editor's draft available too, which may be more up-to-date.)
