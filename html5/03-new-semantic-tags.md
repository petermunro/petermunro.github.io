# New Semantic Elements

1. Convert the following document into HTML5:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>simple HTML 4.01 document</title>
<p>
This is a simple HTML 4.01 document.  Turn it into a simple HTML5
document!
</p>
```

2. Convert this page to HTML5:

``` html
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transition//EN"
	"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html>
<head>
	<title>XHTML vs HTMl5</title>
</head>
<body>
</style>
<h1>XHTML 1 vs HTML 5</h1>

<div class="nav">

<div class="content">What is the deal about?  For years, the W3C,
web developers and web browser implementors were promoting XHTML 1.0.
This was the future of web development.  A combination of html, xml, and
css moving away from the previous reliance on html tags and attributes
for formatting and layout.  With xml, new tags could extend the language.
XHTML 2.0 promised to deliver more capabilities.  But html refuses to die.
The html 4 language, already implemented in browsers, made substantial
changes to promote css.  And in a surprise move earlier this year, W3C
decided that the standard for web browsers should be html5, not xhtml2!
What does this mean for us as a class?  Not much at this point.  The html5
language is still 2 years from full release and while browsers are being
implemented now, we don't have to worry about continuing to use xhtml 1
for some time.  However, its best to understand what html5 is and begin
to adopt its standards as we move forward.</div>

Ficticious dialog:<br />
W3C person:  We give our support to html5<br />
A web developer:  Aaaarrrrggggghhhh, I just finished my web site using xhtml 2<br />
A person who loves Ruby:  I don't care, will it support Ruby scripting?<br />
A computer scientist:  I don't really care, I do server side programming<br />
A business informaticist:  I don't care as long as IE supports it<br />
An IT person:  Does this mean I have to reinstall my web server or proxy server?<br />
Tim Berners-Lee:  One step closer to the semantic web...<br />
An INF 286 teacher:  Aaaaaarrrrgggghhh, I have to modify my notes!<br />
